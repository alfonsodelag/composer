# Composer
Composer is a tool that manages the dependencies of our PHP project. Thanks to this tool, we can work with the installation of those libraries that our project needs in a comfortable way, avoiding all the problems involved in installing the dependencies manually and without any control or supervision.

The dependencies are installed in a directory (default called / vendor). What if my bookstores depend on others? It is also able to solve that and download everything necessary to make it work and thus avoid doing it manually.
